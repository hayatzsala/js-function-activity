# FUNCTIONS LAB

## Overview 
Write some functions that will do basic mathematical expressions and string manipulation. 

## Instructions
1. Build 4 functions that adds, multiplies, divides and subtracts 2 numbers and prints the results to the screen with console.log.
2. Build a function expression which deals with concatenating 2 strings with a space between them. Bonus points if you do not use "+" operator.
3. Write a function with arrow function syntax which calculates the area of a cylinder with a diameter(R) of 4 and height of 5. You can take Pi as 3,14. (This is a bonus activity, but please go ahead and try!)
